# GraphQL Server Example

This example shows how to implement a **GraphQL server with TypeScript** based on [Photon JS](https://photonjs.prisma.io/), [graphql-yoga](https://github.com/prisma/graphql-yoga) and [GraphQL Nexus](https://nexus.js.org/).

## How to use

### 1. Install the Prisma 2 CLI

To run the example, you need the [Prisma 2 CLI](https://github.com/prisma/prisma2/blob/master/docs/prisma-2-cli.md):

```sh
npm install -g prisma2
```

### 2. Install dependencies

Install Node dependencies:

```
npm install
```

### 4. Generate Photon (type-safe database client)

Run the following command to generate [Photon JS](https://photonjs.prisma.io/):

```sh
prisma2 generate
```

Now you can seed your database using the `seed` script from `package.json`:

```sh
npm run seed
```

### 5. Start the GraphQL server

Launch your GraphQL server with this command:

```
npm run start
```

Navigate to [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) in your browser to explore the API of your GraphQL server in a [GraphQL Playground](https://github.com/prisma/graphql-playground).

### 6. Using the GraphQL API

The schema that specifies the API operations of your GraphQL server is defined in [`./src/schema.graphql`](./src/schema.graphql). Below are a number of operations that you can send to the API using the GraphQL Playground.

Feel free to adjust any operation by adding or removing fields. The GraphQL Playground helps you with its auto-completion and query validation features.

### 7. Changing the GraphQL schema

To make changes to the GraphQL schema, you need to manipulate the `Query` and `Mutation` types that are defined in [`index.ts`](./src/index.ts).

Note that the [`start`](./package.json#L4) script also starts a development server that automatically updates your schema every time you save a file. This way, the auto-generated [GraphQL schema](./src/schema.graphql) updates whenever you make changes in to the `Query` or `Mutation` types inside your TypeScript code.
